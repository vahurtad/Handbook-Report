# HandBook Report
This project is the final website for [The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights](https://policing.civilrights.org) and was made using Worpdress with [GeneratePress Theme](https://github.com/tomusborne/generatepress). 

The final website can be seen here: [Handbook Report](https://policing.civilrights.org/report/) 

### Timeline

Initially the timeline was 3 months, then was ultimately changed to a few more.
This is my most recent work that the public can see the final product. 

Since in this project I had a lot of freedom on how to build it, I always looked for the best and easiest way where the client would be able to add content without adding code. A lot of the time I found myself researching, testing, and rebuilding from any feedback given to implement the features needed for the website the client had asked for. 

This project was pushed to a few more months because there was a period where everyone in the project had to wait for the client to accept the new design from scratch and some time was lost.

### Collaboration

My job in this project was to build the Handbook Report website with a lot of freedom to find what features and tools I could use to ease content addition for the client to use without adding any extra code. 
I was part of a team that consisted of designers, other programmers, content manager and lead to communicate with client but was the only programmer in charge of building this website. This team was formed through the help of [Wethos](https://www.wethos.co/).

### Challenges

Even Though I have already used WordPress before this project, achieving what the client wanted within the time frame was the big challenge. Working remotely is also a big challenge, as there was some miscommunication that happened throughout the period of waiting for the client to accept the new design.

In this project, I learned a lot about adding custom fields and custom WYSIWYG tools which helped give the client an easier way to add different kinds of content.
